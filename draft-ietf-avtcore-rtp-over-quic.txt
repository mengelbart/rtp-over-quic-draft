                draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a minimal mapping for encapsulating Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) packets
   within the QUIC protocol.  This mapping is called RTP over QUIC
   (RoQ).

   This document also discusses how to leverage state that is already
   available from the QUIC implementation in the endpoints, in order to
   reduce the need to exchange RTCP packets, and describes different
   options for implementing congestion control and rate adaptation for
   RTP without relying on RTCP feedback.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a minimal mapping for encapsulating Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
   [RFC3550] packets within the QUIC protocol ([RFC9000]).  This mapping
   is called RTP over QUIC (RoQ).

   This document also discusses how to leverage state that is already
   available from the QUIC implementation in the endpoints, in order to
   reduce the need to exchange RTCP packets, and describes different
   options for implementing congestion control and rate adaptation for
   RTP without relying on RTCP feedback.

1.1.  Background

   The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550] is generally used to
   carry real-time media for conversational media sessions, such as
   video conferences, across the Internet.  Since RTP requires real-time
   delivery and is tolerant to packet losses, the default underlying
   transport protocol has historically been UDP [RFC0768], but a large
   variety of other underlying transport protocols have been defined for
   various reasons (e.g., securing media exchange, or providing a
   fallback when UDP is blocked along a network path).  This document
   describes RTP over QUIC, providing one more underlying transport
   protocol.  The reasons for using QUIC as an underlying transport
   protocol are given in Section 3.1.

   This document describes an application usage of QUIC ([RFC9308]).  As
   a baseline, the document does not expect more than a standard QUIC
   implementation as defined in [RFC8999], [RFC9000], [RFC9001], and
   [RFC9002], providing a secure end-to-end transport.  Beyond this
   baseline, real-time applications can benefit from QUIC extensions
   such as unreliable DATAGRAMs [RFC9221], which provides additional
   desirable properties for real-time traffic (e.g., no unnecessary
   retransmissions, avoiding head-of-line blocking).

1.2.  What's in Scope for this Document

   This document focuses on providing a secure encapsulation of RTP and
   RTCP packets for transmission over QUIC.  The expected usage is
   wherever RTP is used to carry media packets, allowing QUIC in place
   of other underlying transport protocols.  We expect RoQ to be used in
   contexts where a signaling protocol is used to announce or negotiate
   a media encapsulation for RTP and the associated transport parameters
   (such as IP address, port number).  RoQ does not provide a stand-
   alone media transport capability, because at a minimum, media
   transport parameters would need to be statically configured.

   RoQ can be used in many of the point-to-point and multi-endpoint RTP
   topologies described in [RFC7667], and can be used with both
   decentralized and centralized control topologies.  When RoQ is used
   in a decentralized topology, RTP packets are exchanged directly
   between ultimate RTP endpoints.  When RoQ is used in a centralized
   topology, RTP packets transit one or more middleboxes which might
   function as mixers or translators between ultimate RTP endpoints.
   RoQ can also be used in RTP client-server-style settings, e.g., when
   talking to a conference server as described in RFC 7667 ([RFC7667]),
   or, if RoQ is used to replace RTSP ([RFC7826]), to a media server.

   Moreover, this document describes how a QUIC implementation and its
   API can be extended to improve efficiency of the RoQ protocol
   operation.

   RoQ does not limit the usage of RTP Audio Video Profiles (AVP)
   ([RFC3551]), or any RTP-based mechanisms, although it might render
   some of them unnecessary, e.g., Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol
   (SRTP) ([RFC3711]) might not be needed, because end-to-end security
   is already provided by QUIC, and double encryption by QUIC and by
   SRTP might have more costs than benefits.  Nor does RoQ limit the use
   of RTCP-based mechanisms, although some information or functions
   provided by using RTCP mechanisms might also be available from the
   underlying QUIC implementation.

   RoQ supports multiplexing multiple RTP-based media streams within a
   single QUIC connection and thus using a single (destination IP
   address, destination port number, source IP address, source port
   number, protocol) 5-tuple.  We note that multiple independent QUIC
   connections can be established in parallel using the same 5-tuple.,
   e.g. to carry different media channels.  These connections would be
   logically independent of one another.

1.3.  What's Out of Scope for this Document

   This document does not enhance QUIC for real-time media or define a
   replacement for, or evolution of, RTP.  Work to map other media
   transport protocols to QUIC is under way elsewhere in the IETF.

   This document does not specify RoQ for point-to-multipoint
   applications, because QUIC itself is not defined for multicast
   operation.  The scope of this document is limited to unicast RTP,
   even though nothing would prevent its use in multicast setups if
   future QUIC extensions support multicast.

   RoQ does not define new congestion control and rate adaptation
   algorithms for use with RTP media, and does not specify the use of
   particular congestion control and rate adaptation algorithms for use
   with RTP media.  However, Section 8 discusses multiple ways that
   congestion control and rate adaptation could be performed at the QUIC
   and/or at the RTP layer, and Section 11 describes information
   available at the QUIC layer that could be exposed via an API for the
   benefit of RTP layer implementation.

   RoQ does not define prioritization mechanisms when handling different
   media as those would be dependent on the media themselves and their
   relationships.  Prioritization is left to the application using RoQ.

   This document does not cover signaling for session setup.  SDP for
   RoQ is defined in separate documents such as
   [I-D.draft-dawkins-avtcore-sdp-rtp-quic], and can be carried in any
   signaling protocol that can carry SDP, including the Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) ([RFC3261]), Real-Time Protocols for
   Browser-Based Applications (RTCWeb) ([RFC8825]), or WebRTC-HTTP
   Ingestion Protocol (WHIP) ([I-D.draft-ietf-wish-whip]).

2.  Terminology and Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

      *Note to the Reader:* [RFC3550] actually describes two closely-
      related protocols - the RTP Data Transfer Protocol Section 5 of
      [RFC3550], and the RTP Control Protocol Section 6 of [RFC3550].
      In this document, the term "RTP" refers to the combination of RTP
      Data Transfer Protocol and RTP Control Protocol, because the
      distinction isn't relevant for encapsulation, and the term "RTCP"
      always refers to the RTP Control Protocol.

      *Note to the Reader:* the meaning of the terms "congestion
      avoidance", "congestion control" and "rate adaptation" in the IETF
      community have evolved over the decades since "slow start" and
      "congestion avoidance" were added as mandatory to implement in
      TCP, in Section 4.2.2.15 of [RFC1122].  Historically, "congestion
      control" usually referred to "achieving network stability"
      ([VJMK88]), by protecting the network from senders who continue to
      transmit packets that exceed the ability of the network to carry
      them, even after packet loss occurs (called "congestion
      collapse").

      Modern general-purpose "congestion control" algorithms have moved
      beyond avoiding congestion collapse, and work to avoid
      "bufferbloat", which causes increasing round-trip delays, as
      described in Section 8.2.

      "Rate adaptation" more commonly refers to strategies intended to
      guide senders on when to send "the next packet", so that one-way
      delays along the network path remain minimal.

      When RTP runs over QUIC, as described in this document, QUIC is
      performing congestion control, and the RTP application is
      responsible for performing rate adaptation.

      In this document, these terms are used with the meanings listed
      below, with the recognition that not all the references in this
      document use these terms in the same way.

   The following terms are used in this document:

   Bandwidth Estimation:  An algorithm to estimate the available
      bandwidth of a link in a network.  Such an estimation can be used
      for rate adaptation, i.e., adapt the rate at which an application
      transmits data.

   Congestion Control:  A mechanism to limit the aggregate amount of
      data that has been sent over a path to a receiver but has not been
      acknowledged by the receiver.  This prevents a sender from
      overwhelming the capacity of a path between a sender and a
      receiver, which might cause intermediaries on the path to drop
      packets before they arrive at the receiver.

   Datagram:  The term "datagram" is ambiguous.  Without a qualifier,
      "datagram" could refer to a UDP packet, or a QUIC DATAGRAM frame,
      as defined in QUIC's unreliable DATAGRAM extension [RFC9221], or
      an RTP packet encapsulated in UDP, or an RTP packet capsulated in
      QUIC DATAGRAM frame.  This document uses the uppercase "DATAGRAM"
      to refer to a QUIC DATAGRAM frame and the term RoQ datagram as a
      short form of "RTP packet encapsulated in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame".

   If not explicitly qualified, the term "datagram" in this document
   refers to an RTP packet, and the uppercase "DATAGRAM" refers to a
   QUIC DATAGRAM frame.  This document also uses the term "RoQ datagram"
   as a short form of "RTP packet encapsulated in a QUIC DATAGRAM
   frame".

   Endpoint:  A QUIC client or QUIC server that participates in an RoQ
      session.  "A RoQ endpoint" is used in this document where that
      seems clearer than "an endpoint" without qualification.

   Early data:  Application data carried in a QUIC 0-RTT packet payload,
      as defined in [RFC9000].  In this document, the early data would
      be an RTP packet.

   Frame:  A QUIC frame as defined in [RFC9000].

   Peer:  The term "peer" is ambiguous, and without a qualifier could be
      understood to refer to an RTP endpoint, a RoQ endpoint, or a QUIC
      endpoint.  In this document, a "peer" is "the other RoQ endpoint
      that a RoQ endpoint is communicating with", and does not have
      anything to do with "peer-to-peer" operation versus "client-
      server" operation.

   Rate Adaptation:  An application-level mechanism that adjusts the
      sending rate of an application in response to changing path
      conditions.  For example, an application sending video might
      respond to indications of congestion by adjusting the resolution
      of the video it is sending.

   Receiver:  An endpoint that receives media in RTP packets and might
      send or receive RTCP packets.

   Sender:  An endpoint that sends media in RTP packets and might send
      or receive RTCP packets.

   Stream:  The term "stream" is ambiguous.  Without a qualifier,
      "stream" could refer to a QUIC stream, as defined in [RFC9000], a
      series of media samples, or a series of RTP packets.  If not
      explicitly qualified, the term "stream" in this document refers to
      a QUIC stream and the term "STREAM" refers to a single QUIC STREAM
      frame.  This document also uses the term "RTP stream" or "RTCP
      streams" as a short form of "a series of RTP packets" or "a series
      of RTCP packets", the term "RoQ stream" as a short form of "one or
      more RTP packets encapsulated in QUIC streams" and the term "media
      stream" as a short form of "a series of one or more media
      samples".

   Packet diagrams in this document use the format defined in
   Section 1.3 of [RFC9000] to illustrate the order and size of fields.

3.  Protocol Overview

   This document introduces a mapping of the Real-time Transport
   Protocol (RTP) to the QUIC transport protocol.  RoQ allows the use of
   both QUIC streams and QUIC DATAGRAMs to transport real-time data, and
   thus, if RTP packets are to be sent over QUIC DATAGRAMs, the QUIC
   implementation MUST support QUIC's DATAGRAM extension.

   [RFC3550] specifies that RTP sessions need to be transmitted on
   different transport addresses to allow multiplexing between them.
   RoQ uses a different approach to leverage the advantages of QUIC
   connections without managing a separate QUIC connection per RTP
   session.  [RFC9221] does not provide demultiplexing between different
   flows on DATAGRAMs but suggests that an application implement a
   demultiplexing mechanism if required.  An example of such a mechanism
   would be flow identifiers prepended to each DATAGRAM frame as
   described in Section 2.1 of [I-D.draft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram].  RoQ
   uses a flow identifier to replace the network address and port number
   to multiplex many RTP sessions over the same QUIC connection.

   An RTP application is responsible for determining what to send in an
   encoded media stream, and how to send that encoded media stream
   within a targeted bitrate.

   This document does not mandate how an application determines what to
   send in an encoded media stream, because decisions about what to send
   within a targeted bitrate, and how to adapt to changes in the
   targeted bitrate, can depend on the application and on the codec in
   use.  For example, adjusting quantization in response to changing
   network conditions might work well in many cases, but if what's being
   shared is video that includes text, maintaining readability is
   important.

   As of this writing, the IETF has produced two Experimental-track
   congestion control documents for real-time media, Network-Assisted
   Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) [RFC8698] and Self-Clocked Rate Adaptation
   for Multimedia (SCReAM) [RFC8298].  These congestion control
   algorithms use feedback about the network's performance to calculate
   target bitrates.  When these algorithms are used with RTP, the
   necessary feedback is generated at the receiver and sent back to the
   sender via RTCP.

   Since QUIC itself collects some metrics about the network's
   performance, these QUIC metrics can be used to generate the required
   feedback at the sender-side and provide it to the congestion control
   algorithm to avoid the additional overhead of the RTCP stream.  This
   is discussed in more detail in Section 10.

3.1.  Motivation

   From time to time, someone asks the reasonable question, "why would
   anyone implement and deploy RoQ"?  This reasonable question deserves
   a better answer than "because we can".  Upon reflection, the
   following motivations seem useful to state.

   The motivations in this section are in no particular order, and this
   reflects the reality that not all implementers and deployers would
   agree on "the most important motivations".

3.1.1.  "Always-On" Transport-level Authentication and Encryption

   Although application-level mechanisms to encrypt RTP payloads have
   existed since the introduction of the Secure Real-time Transport
   Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711], the additional encryption of RTP header
   fields and contributing sources has only been defined recently (in
   Cryptex [RFC9335]), and both SRTP and Cryptex are optional
   capabilities for RTP.

   This is in sharp contrast to "always-on" transport-level encryption
   in the QUIC protocol, using Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3) as
   described in [RFC9001].  QUIC implementations always authenticate the
   entirety of each packet, and encrypt as much of each packet as is
   practical, even switching from "long headers", which expose the QUIC
   header fields needed to establish a connection, to "short headers",
   which only expose the absolute minimum QUIC header fields needed to
   identify an existing connection to the receiver, so that the QUIC
   payload is presented to the correct QUIC application [RFC8999].

3.1.2.  "Always-On" Internet-Safe Congestion Control

   When RTP is carried directly over UDP, as is commonly done, the
   underlying UDP protocol provides multiplexing using UDP ports, but no
   transport services beyond multiplexing are provided to the
   application.  All congestion control behavior is up to the RTP
   application itself, and if anything goes wrong with the application
   and this condition results in an RTP sender failing to recognize that
   it is contributing to path congestion, the "worst case" response is
   to invoke the RTP "circuit breaker" procedures [RFC8083].  These
   procedures result in "ceasing transmission", as described in
   Section 4.5 of [RFC8083].  Because RTCP-based circuit breakers only
   detect long-lived congestion, a response based on these mechanisms
   will not happen quickly.

   In contrast, when RTP is carried over QUIC, QUIC implementations
   maintain their own estimates of key transport parameters needed to
   detect and respond to possible congestion, and these estimates are
   independent of any measurements RTP senders and receivers are
   maintaining.  The result is that even if an RTP sender attempts to
   "send" in the presence of persistent path congestion, QUIC congestion
   control procedures (for example, the procedures defined in [RFC9002])
   will cause the RTP packets to be buffered while QUIC responds to
   detected packet loss.  This happens without RTP senders taking any
   action, but the RTP sender has no control over this QUIC mechanism.

   Moreover, when a single QUIC connection is used to multiplex both RTP
   and non-RTP packets as described in Section 3.1.5, the shared QUIC
   connection will still be Internet-safe, with no coordination
   required.

   While QUIC's response to congestion ensures that RoQ will be
   "Internet-safe", from the network's perspective, it is helpful to
   remember that a QUIC sender responds to detected congestion by
   delaying packets that are already available to send, to give the path
   to the QUIC receiver time to recover from congestion.

   *  If the QUIC connection encapsulates RTP, this means that some RTP
      packets will be delayed, arriving at the receiver later than a
      consumer of the RTP flow might prefer.

   *  If the QUIC connection also encapsulates RTCP, this means that
      these RTCP messages will also be delayed, and will not be sent in
      a timely manner.  This delay will impact RTT measurements using
      RTCP and can interfere with a sender's ability to stabilize rate
      control and achieve audio/video synchronization.

   In summary,

   *  Timely RTP stream-level rate adaptation will give a better user
      experience by minimizing endpoint queuing delays and packet loss,
      but

   *  in the presence of packet loss, QUIC connection-level congestion
      control will respond more quickly and possibly more smoothly to
      the end of congestion than RTP "circuit breakers".

3.1.3.  RTP Rate Adaptation Based on QUIC Feedback

   When RTP is carried directly over UDP, RTP makes use of a large
   number of RTP-specific feedback mechanisms because there is no other
   way to receive feedback.  Some of these mechanisms are specific to
   the type of media RTP is sending, but others can be mapped from
   underlying QUIC implementations that are using this feedback to
   perform congestion control for any QUIC connection, regardless of the
   application reflected in the payload.  This is described in (much)
   more detail in Section 8 on rate adaptation, and in Section 10 on
   replacing RTCP and RTP header extensions with QUIC feedback.

   One word of caution is in order - RTP implementations might rely on
   at least some minimal periodic RTCP feedback, in order to determine
   that an RTP flow is still active, and is not causing sustained
   congestion (as described in [RFC8083].  Because the necessary
   "periodicity" is measured in seconds, the impact of this "duplicate"
   feedback on path bandwidth utilization is likely close to zero.

3.1.4.  Path MTU Discovery and RTP Media Coalescence

   The minimum Path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) supported by
   conformant QUIC implementations is 1200 bytes [RFC9000].  In
   addition, QUIC implementations allow senders to use either DPLPMTUD
   ([RFC8899]) or PMTUD ([RFC1191], [RFC8201]) to determine the actual
   Path MTU size that the receiver can accept, and that the path between
   sender and receiver can support.  The actual Path MTU can be larger
   than the Minimum Path MTU.

   This is especially useful in certain conferencing topologies, where
   otherwise senders would have no choice but to use the lowest Path MTU
   for all conference participants.  Even in point-to-point RTP
   sessions, this also allows senders to piggyback audio media in the
   same UDP packet as video media, for example, and also allows QUIC
   receivers to piggyback QUIC ACK frames on any QUIC packets being
   transmitted in the other direction.

3.1.5.  Multiplexing RTP, RTCP, and Non-RTP Flows on a Single QUIC
        Connection

   This document defines a flow identifier for multiplexing multiple RTP
   and RTCP ports on the same QUIC connection to conserve ports,
   especially at NATs and firewalls.  Section 5.1 describes the
   multiplexing in more detail.  Future extensions could further build
   on the flow identifier to multiplex RTP with other protocols on the
   same connection, as long as these protocols can co-exist with RTP
   without interfering with the ability of this connection to carry
   real-time media.

3.1.6.  Exploiting Multiple Paths

   Although there is much interest in multiplexing flows on a single
   QUIC connection as described in Section 3.1.5, QUIC also provides the
   capability of establishing and validating multiple paths for a single
   QUIC connection as described in Section 9 of [RFC9000].  Once
   multiple paths have been validated, a sender can migrate from one
   path to another with no additional signaling, allowing an endpoint to
   move from one endpoint address to another without interruption, as
   long as only a single path is in active use at any point in time.

   Connection migration could be desirable for a number of reasons, but
   to give one example, this allows a QUIC connection to survive address
   changes due to a middlebox allocating a new outgoing port, or even a
   new outgoing IP address.

   The Multipath Extension for QUIC [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath]
   would allow the application to actively use two or more paths
   simultaneously, but in all other respects, this functionality is the
   same as QUIC connection migration.

   A sender can use these capabilities to more effectively exploit
   multiple paths between sender and receiver with no action required
   from the application, even if these paths have different path
   characteristics.  Examples of these different path characteristics
   include senders handling paths differently if one path has higher
   available bandwidth and the other has lower one-way latency, or if
   one is a more costly cellular path and the other is a less costly
   WiFi path.

   Some of these differences can be detected by QUIC itself, while other
   differences must be described to QUIC based on policy, etc.  Possible
   RTP implementation strategies for path selection and utilization are
   not discussed in this document.  Path scheduling APIs to let
   applications control these mechanisms are a topic for future research
   and might need further specification in future documents.

3.1.7.  Exploiting New QUIC Capabilities

   The first version of the QUIC protocol described in [RFC9000] has
   been completed, but extensions to QUIC are still under active
   development in the IETF.  Because of this, using QUIC as a transport
   for a mature protocol like RTP allows developers to exploit new
   transport capabilities as they become available.

3.2.  RTP with QUIC Streams, QUIC DATAGRAMs, and a Mixture of Both

   This document describes the use of QUIC streams and DATAGRAMs as RTP
   encapsulations but does not take a position on which encapsulation an
   application ought to use.  Indeed, an application can use both QUIC
   streams and DATAGRAM encapsulations on the same QUIC connection.  The
   choice of encapsulation is left to the application developer, but it
   is worth noting differences that are relevant when making this
   choice.

   QUIC [RFC9000] was initially designed to carry HTTP [RFC9114] in QUIC
   streams, and QUIC streams provide what HTTP application developers
   need - for example, a stateful, connection-oriented, flow-controlled,
   reliable, ordered stream of bytes to an application.  QUIC streams
   can be multiplexed over a single QUIC connection, using stream IDs to
   demultiplex incoming messages.

   QUIC DATAGRAMs [RFC9221] were developed as a QUIC extension, intended
   to support applications that do not need reliable delivery of
   application data.  This extension defines two DATAGRAM frame types
   (one including a length field, the other not including a length
   field), and these DATAGRAM frames can co-exist with QUIC streams
   within a single QUIC connection, sharing the connection's
   cryptographic and authentication context, and congestion controller
   context.

   There is no default relative priority between DATAGRAM frames with
   respect to each other, and there is no default priority between
   DATAGRAM frames and QUIC STREAM frames.  QUIC implementations can
   present an API to allow applications to assign relative priorities
   within a QUIC connection, but this is not mandated by the standard
   and might not be present in all implementations.

   Because DATAGRAMs are an extension to QUIC, they inherit a great deal
   of functionality from QUIC (much of which is described in
   Section 3.1); so much so that it is easier to explain what DATAGRAMs
   do NOT inherit.

   *  DATAGRAM frames do not provide any explicit flow control
      signaling.  This means that a QUIC receiver might not be able to
      commit the necessary resources to process incoming frames, but the
      purpose for DATAGRAM frames is to carry application-level
      information that can be lost and will not be retransmitted.

   *  DATAGRAM frames cannot be fragmented.  They are limited in size by
      the max_datagram_frame_size transport parameter, and further
      limited by the max_udp_payload_size transport parameter and the
      Path MTU between endpoints.

   *  DATAGRAM frames belong to a QUIC connection as a whole.  There is
      no QUIC-level way to multiplex/demultiplex DATAGRAM frames within
      a single QUIC connection.  Any multiplexing identifiers must be
      added, interpreted, and removed by an application, and they will
      be sent as part of the payload of the DATAGRAM frame itself.

   DATAGRAM frames do inherit the QUIC connection's congestion
   controller.  This means that although there is no frame-level flow
   control, DATAGRAM frames can be delayed until the controller allows
   them to be sent or dropped (with an optional notification to the
   sending application).  Implementations can also delay sending
   DATAGRAM frames to maintain consistent packet pacing (as described in
   Section 7.7 of [RFC9002]), and can allow an application to specify a
   sending expiration time, but these capabilities are not mandated by
   the standard and might not be present in all implementations.

   Because DATAGRAMs are an extension to QUIC, a RoQ endpoint cannot
   assume that its peer supports this extension.  The RoQ endpoint might
   discover that its peer does not support DATAGRAMs in one of two ways:

   *  as part of the signaling process to set up QUIC connections, or

   *  during negotiation of the DATAGRAM extension during the QUIC
      handshake.

   When either of these situations happen, the RoQ endpoint needs to
   make a decision about what to do next.

   *  If the use of DATAGRAMs was critical for the application, the
      endpoint can simply close the QUIC connection, allowing someone or
      something to correct this mismatch, so that DATAGRAMs can be used.

   *  If the use of DATAGRAMs was not critical for the application, the
      endpoint can negotiate the use of QUIC streams instead.

3.3.  Supported RTP Topologies

   RoQ supports only some of the RTP topologies described in [RFC7667].
   Most notably, due to QUIC [RFC9000] being a purely IP unicast
   protocol at the time of writing, RoQ cannot be used as a transport
   protocol for any of the paths that rely on IP multicast in several
   multicast topologies (e.g., _Topo-ASM_, _Topo-SSM_, _Topo-SSM-RAMS_).

   Some "multicast topologies" can include IP unicast paths (e.g.,
   _Topo-SSM_, _Topo-SSM-RAMS_).  In these cases, the unicast paths can
   use RoQ.

   RTP supports different types of translators and mixers.  Whenever a
   middlebox needs to access the content of QUIC frames (e.g., _Topo-
   PtP-Translator_, _Topo-PtP-Relay_, _Topo-Trn-Translator_, _Topo-
   Media-Translator_), the QUIC connection will be terminated at that
   middlebox.

   RoQ streams (see Section 5.2) can support much larger RTP packet
   sizes than other transport protocols such as UDP can, which can lead
   to problems when transport translators which translate from RoQ to
   RTP over a different transport protocol.  A similar problem can occur
   if a translator needs to translate from RTP over UDP to RoQ over
   DATAGRAMs, where the max_datagram_frame_size of a QUIC DATAGRAM can
   be smaller than the MTU of a UDP datagram.  In both cases, the
   translator might need to rewrite the RTP packets to fit into the
   smaller MTU of the other protocol.  Such a translator might need
   codec-specific knowledge to packetize the payload of the incoming RTP
   packets in smaller RTP packets.

                                  Table 1

   Note-NAT:  Not supported, because QUIC [RFC9000] does not support NAT
      traversal.

   Note-MTU:  Supported, but might require MTU adaptation.

   Note-Sec:  Note that because RoQ uses QUIC as its underlying
      transport, and QUIC authenticates the entirety of each packet and
      encrypts as much of each packet as is practical, RoQ secures both
      RTP headers and RTP payloads, while other RTP transports do not.
      Section 15 describes strategies to prevent the inadvertent
      disclosure of RTP sessions to unintended third parties.

   Note-MCast:  Not supported, because QUIC [RFC9000] does not support
      IP multicast.

   Note-UCast-MCast:  The topology refers to a _Distribution Source_,
      which receives and relays RTP from a number of different media
      senders via unicast before relaying it to the receivers via
      multicast.  QUIC can be used between the senders and the
      _Distribution Source_.

   Note-MCast-UCast:  The topology refers to a _Burst Source_ or
      _Retransmission Source_, which retransmits RTP to receivers via
      unicast.  QUIC can be used between the _Retransmission Source_ and
      the receivers.

   Note-Topo-PtM-Trn-Translator:  Supported for IP unicast paths between
      RTP sources and translators.

   Note-Topo-Mixer:  Supported for IP unicast paths between RTP senders
      and mixers.

   Note-Warn:  Quote from [RFC7667]: _This topology is so problematic
      and it is so easy to get the RTCP processing wrong, that it is NOT
      RECOMMENDED to implement this topology._

4.  Connection Establishment and Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation

   QUIC requires the use of Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation
   (ALPN) [RFC7301] tokens during connection setup.  RoQ uses "roq" as
   the ALPN token, included as part of the TLS handshake (see also
   Section 16).

   Note that the "roq" ALPN token is not tied to a specific RTP profile,
   even though the RTP profile could be considered part of the
   application usage.  This allows different RTP sessions, which might
   use different RTP profiles, to be carried within the same QUIC
   connection.

4.1.  Draft version identification

      *RFC Editor's note:* Please remove this section prior to
      publication of a final version of this document.

   RoQ uses the ALPN token "roq" to identify itself during QUIC
   connection setup.

   Only implementations of the final, published RFC can identify
   themselves as "roq".  Until such an RFC exists, implementations MUST
   NOT identify themselves using this string.

   Implementations of draft versions of the protocol MUST add the string
   "-" and the corresponding draft number to the identifier.  For
   example, draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-09 is identified using the
   string "roq-09".

   Non-compatible experiments that are based on these draft versions
   MUST append the string "-" and an experiment name to the identifier.

5.  Encapsulation

   This section describes the encapsulation of RTP packets in QUIC.

   QUIC supports two transport methods: QUIC streams [RFC9000] and
   DATAGRAMs [RFC9221].  This document specifies mappings of RTP to both
   transport modes.  Senders MAY combine both modes by sending some RTP
   packets over the same or different QUIC streams and others in
   DATAGRAMs.

   Section 5.1 introduces a multiplexing mechanism that supports
   multiplexing multiple RTP sessions and RTCP.  Section 5.2 and
   Section 5.3 explain the specifics of mapping RTP to QUIC streams and
   DATAGRAMs, respectively.

5.1.  Multiplexing

   RoQ uses flow identifiers to multiplex different RTP streams on a
   single QUIC connection.  A flow identifier is a QUIC variable-length
   integer as described in Section 16 of [RFC9000].  Each flow
   identifier is associated with an RTP stream.

   In a QUIC connection using the ALPN token defined in Section 4, every
   DATAGRAM and every QUIC stream MUST start with a flow identifier.  An
   endpoint MUST NOT send any data in a DATAGRAM or stream that is not
   associated with the flow identifier which started the DATAGRAM or
   stream.

   RTP packets of different RTP sessions MUST use distinct flow
   identifiers.  If endpoints wish to send multiple types of media in a
   single RTP session, they can do so by following the guidance
   specified in [RFC8860].

   A single RTP session can be associated with one or two flow
   identifiers.  Thus, it is possible to send RTP and RTCP packets
   belonging to the same session using different flow identifiers.  RTP
   and RTCP packets of a single RTP session can use the same flow
   identifier (following the procedures defined in [RFC5761]), or they
   can use different flow identifiers.

   Endpoints need to associate flow identifiers with RTP streams.
   Depending on the context of the application, the association can be
   statically configured, signaled using an out-of-band signaling
   mechanism (e.g., SDP), or applications might be able to identify the
   stream based on the RTP packets sent on the stream (e.g., by
   inspecting the payload type).

   If an endpoint receives a flow identifier that it cannot associate
   with an RTP stream, the endpoint MAY close the connection using the
   ROQ_UNKNOWN_FLOW_ID error code.  Closing the connection can be a
   valid response if it is not expected that out of band signaling is
   still ongoing and the application cannot handle unknown flow
   identifiers.

   If the association of flow identifiers with RTP streams depends on
   out-of-band signaling, the signaling mechanism SHOULD be completed
   before the exchange of RTP packets using the new flow identifiers
   starts.

   In cases where it cannot be guaranteed that signaling is completed
   before RTP packets are transmitted, streams or DATAGRAMs with a given
   flow identifer can arrive before the signaling finished.  In that
   case, an endpoint cannot associate the stream or DATAGRAM with the
   corresponding RTP stream.  The endpoint can buffer streams and
   DATAGRAMs using an unknown flow identifier until they can be
   associated with the corresponding RTP stream.  To avoid resource
   exhaustion, the buffering endpoint MUST limit the number of streams
   and DATAGRAMs to buffer.  If the number of buffered streams exceeds
   the limit on buffered streams, the endpoint MUST send a STOP_SENDING
   with the error code ROQ_UNKNOWN_FLOW_ID.  It is an implementation's
   choice on which stream to send STOP_SENDING.  If the number of
   buffered DATAGRAMs exceeds the limit on buffered DATAGRAMs, the
   endpoint MUST drop a DATAGRAM.  It is an implementation's choice
   which DATAGRAMs to drop.

   Flow identifiers introduce some overhead in addition to the header
   overhead of RTP and QUIC.  QUIC variable-length integers require
   between one and eight bytes depending on the number expressed.  Thus,
   using low numbers as session identifiers first will minimize this
   additional overhead.

5.2.  QUIC Streams

   To send RTP packets over QUIC streams, a sender MUST open at least
   one new unidirectional QUIC stream.  RoQ uses unidirectional streams,
   because there is no synchronous relationship between sent and
   received RTP packets.  An endpoint that receives a bidirectional
   stream with a flow identifier that is associated with an RTP stream,
   MUST stop reading from the stream and send a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame
   with the frame type set to APPLICATION_ERROR and the error code set
   to ROQ_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR.

   The underlying QUIC implementation might be acting as either a QUIC
   client or QUIC server, so the unidirectional QUIC stream can be
   either client-initiated or server-initiated, as described in
   Section 2.1 of [RFC9000], depending on the role.  The QUIC
   implementation's role is not controlled by RoQ, and can be negotiated
   using a separate signaling protocol.

   A RoQ sender can open new QUIC streams for different RTP packets
   using the same flow identifier.  This allows RoQ senders to use QUIC
   streams while avoiding head-of-line blocking.

   Because a sender can continue sending on a stream with a lower stream
   identifier after starting packet transmission on a stream with a
   higher stream identifier, a RoQ receiver MUST be prepared to receive
   RoQ packets on any number of QUIC streams (subject to its limit on
   parallel open streams) and MUST NOT make assumptions about which RTP
   sequence numbers are carried in any particular stream.

5.2.1.  Stream Encapsulation

   Figure 1 shows the encapsulation format for RoQ Streams.

   Payload {
     Flow Identifier (i),
     RTP Payload(..) ...,
   }

                    Figure 1: RoQ Streams Payload Format

   Flow Identifier:  Flow identifier to demultiplex different data flows
      on the same QUIC connection.

   RTP Payload:  Contains the RTP payload; see Figure 2

   The payload in a QUIC stream starts with the flow identifier followed
   by one or more RTP payloads.  All RTP payloads sent on a stream MUST
   belong to the RTP session with the same flow identifier.

   Each payload begins with a length field indicating the length of the
   RTP packet, followed by the packet itself, see Figure 2.

   RTP Payload {
     Length(i),
     RTP Packet(..),
   }

                   Figure 2: RTP payload for QUIC streams

   Length:  A QUIC variable length integer (see Section 16 of [RFC9000])
      describing the length of the following RTP packets in bytes.

   RTP Packet:  The RTP packet to transmit.

5.2.2.  Media Frame Cancellation

   QUIC uses RESET_STREAM and STOP_SENDING frames to terminate the
   sending part of a stream and to request termination of an incoming
   stream by the sending peer respectively.

   A RoQ receiver that is no longer interested in reading a certain
   portion of the media stream can signal this to the sending peer using
   a STOP_SENDING frame.

   If a RoQ sender discovers that a packet is no longer needed and knows
   that the packet has not yet been successfully and completely
   transmitted, it can use RESET_STREAM to tell the RoQ receiver that
   the RoQ sender is discarding the packet.

   In both cases, the error code of the RESET_STREAM frame or the
   STOP_SENDING frame MUST be set to ROQ_FRAME_CANCELLED.

   STOP_SENDING is not a request to the sender to stop sending RTP
   media, only an indication that a RoQ receiver stopped reading the
   QUIC stream being used to carry that RTP media.  This can mean that
   the RoQ receiver is no longer able to use the media frames being
   received because they are "too old".  A sender with additional media
   frames to send can continue sending them on another QUIC stream.
   Alternatively, new media frames can be sent as DATAGRAMs (see
   Section 5.3).  In either case, a RoQ sender resuming operation after
   receiving STOP_SENDING can continue starting with the newest media
   frames available for sending.  This allows a RoQ receiver to "fast
   forward" to media frames that are "new enough" to be used.

   Any media frame that has already been sent on the QUIC stream that
   received the STOP_SENDING frame, MUST NOT be sent again on the new
   QUIC stream(s) or DATAGRAMs.

   Note that an RTP receiver cannot request a reset of a particular
   media frame because the sending QUIC implementation might already
   have sent data for one or more following media frames on the same
   stream.  In that case, STOP_SENDING and the resulting RESET_STREAM
   would also discard the following media frames and thus lead to
   unintentionally skipping one or more media frames.

   A translator that translates between two endpoints, both connected
   via QUIC, MUST forward RESET_STREAM frames received from one end to
   the other unless it forwards the RTP packets encapsulated in
   DATAGRAMs.

   QUIC implementations will fragment large RTP packets into smaller
   QUIC STREAM frames.  The data carried in these QUIC STREAM frames is
   transmitted reliably and is delivered to the receiving application in
   order, so that a receiving application can read a complete RTP packet
   from the stream as long as the stream is not closed with a
   RESET_STREAM frame.  No retransmission has to be implemented by the
   application since data that was carried in QUIC frames that were lost
   in transit is retransmitted by QUIC.

5.2.3.  Flow control and MAX_STREAMS

   In order to permit QUIC streams to open, a RoQ sender MUST configure
   non-zero minimum values for the number of permitted streams and the
   initial stream flow-control window.  These minimum values control the
   number of parallel, or simultaneously active, RTP flows.  Endpoints
   that excessively restrict the number of streams or the flow-control
   window of these streams will increase the chance that the sending
   peer reaches the limit early and becomes blocked.

   Opening new streams for new packets can implicitly limit the number
   of packets concurrently in transit because the QUIC receiver provides
   an upper bound of parallel streams, which it can update using QUIC
   MAX_STREAMS frames.  The number of packets that can be transmitted
   concurrently depends on several factors, such as the number of RTP
   streams within a QUIC connection, the bitrate of the media streams,
   and the maximum acceptable transmission delay of a given packet.
   Receivers are responsible for providing senders enough credit to open
   new streams for new packets at any time.

   As an example, consider a conference scenario with 20 participants.
   Each participant receives audio and video streams of every other
   participant from a central RTP middlebox.  If the sender opens a new
   QUIC stream for every frame at 30 frames per second video and 50
   frames per second audio, it will open 1520 new QUIC streams per
   second.  A receiver must provide at least that many credits for
   opening new unidirectional streams to the RTP middlebox every second.

   In addition, the receiver ought to also consider the requirements of
   RTCP streams.  These considerations can also be relevant when
   implementing signaling since it can be necessary to inform the
   receiver about how many stream credits it will have to provide to the
   sending peer, and how rapidly it must provide these stream credits.

5.3.  QUIC DATAGRAMs

   Senders can also transmit RTP packets in QUIC DATAGRAMs, using a QUIC
   extension described in [RFC9221].  DATAGRAMs can only be used if the
   use of the DATAGRAM extension was successfully negotiated during the
   QUIC handshake.  If the DATAGRAM extension was negotiated using a
   signaling protocol, but was not also negotiated during the resulting
   QUIC handshake, an endpoint can close the connection with the
   ROQ_EXPECTATION_UNMET error code.

   DATAGRAMs preserve application frame boundaries.  Thus, a single RTP
   packet can be mapped to a single DATAGRAM without additional framing.
   Because QUIC DATAGRAMs cannot be IP-fragmented (Section 5 of
   [RFC9221]), senders need to consider the header overhead associated
   with DATAGRAMs, and ensure that the RTP packets, including their
   payloads, flow identifier, QUIC, and IP headers, will fit into the
   Path MTU.

   Figure 3 shows the encapsulation format for RoQ Datagrams.

   Payload {
     Flow Identifier (i),
     RTP Packet (..),
   }

                   Figure 3: RoQ Datagram Payload Format

   Flow Identifier:  Flow identifier to demultiplex different data flows
      on the same QUIC connection.

   RTP Packet:  The RTP packet to transmit.

   RoQ senders need to be aware that QUIC uses the concept of QUIC
   frames, and QUIC connections use different kinds of QUIC frames to
   carry different application and control data types.  A single QUIC
   packet can contain more than one QUIC frame, including, for example,
   QUIC STREAM frames or DATAGRAM frames carrying application data and
   ACK frames carrying QUIC acknowledgments, as long as the overall size
   fits into the MTU.  One implication is that the number of packets a
   QUIC stack transmits depends on whether it can fit ACK and DATAGRAM
   frames in the same QUIC packet.  Suppose the application creates many
   DATAGRAM frames that fill up the QUIC packet.  In that case, the QUIC
   stack would need to create additional packets for ACK frames, and
   possibly other control frames.  The additional overhead could, in
   some cases, be reduced if the application creates smaller RTP
   packets, such that the resulting DATAGRAM frame can fit into a QUIC
   packet that can also carry ACK frames.  Another implication is that
   multiple RTP packets in either QUIC streams or QUIC DATAGRAMs might
   be encapsulated in a single QUIC packet, which is discussed in more
   detail in Section 12.3.

   Since DATAGRAMs are not retransmitted on loss (see also Section 10.4
   for loss signaling), if an application is using DATAGRAMs and wishes
   to retransmit lost RTP packets, the application has to carry out that
   retransmission.  RTP retransmissions can be done in the same RTP
   session or in a different RTP session [RFC4588] and the flow
   identifier MUST be set to the flow identifier of the RTP session in
   which the retransmission happens.

6.  Connection Shutdown

   Either endpoint can close the connection for any of a variety of
   reasons.  If one of the endpoints wants to close the RoQ connection,
   the endpoint can use a QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with one of the
   error codes defined in Section 7.

7.  Error Handling

   The following error codes are defined for use when abruptly
   terminating RoQ streams, aborting reading of RoQ streams, or
   immediately closing RoQ connections.

   ROQ_NO_ERROR (0x00):  No error.  This is used when the connection or
      stream needs to be closed, but there is no error to signal.

   ROQ_GENERAL_ERROR (0x01):  An error that does not match a more
      specific error code occurred.

   ROQ_INTERNAL_ERROR (0x02):  An internal error has occurred in the RoQ
      stack.

   ROQ_PACKET_ERROR (0x03):  Invalid payload format, e.g., length does
      not match packet, invalid flow id encoding, non-RTP on RTP-flow
      ID, etc.

   ROQ_STREAM_CREATION_ERROR (0x04):  The endpoint detected that its
      peer created a stream that violates the ROQ protocol, e.g., a
      bidirectional stream, for sending RTP packets.

   ROQ_FRAME_CANCELLED (0x05):  A receiving endpoint is using
      STOP_SENDING on the current stream to request new frames be sent
      on new streams.  Similarly, a sender notifies a receiver that
      retransmissions of a frame were stopped using RESET_STREAM and new
      frames will be sent on new streams.

   ROQ_UNKNOWN_FLOW_ID (0x06):  An endpoint was unable to handle a flow
      identifier, e.g., because it was not signaled or because the
      endpoint does not support multiplexing using arbitrary flow
      identifiers.

   ROQ_EXPECTATION_UNMET (0x07):  RoQ out-of-band signaling set
      expectations for QUIC transport, but the resulting QUIC connection
      would not meet those expectations.

8.  Congestion Control and Rate Adaptation

   Like any other application on the Internet, RoQ applications need a
   mechanism to perform congestion control to avoid overloading the
   network.  QUIC is a congestion-controlled transport protocol.  RTP
   does not mandate a single congestion control mechanism.  RTP suggests
   that the RTP profile defines congestion control according to the
   expected properties of the application's environment.

   This document discusses aspects of transport level congestion control
   in Section 8.1 and application layer rate control in Section 8.2.  It
   does not mandate any specific congestion control algorithm for QUIC
   or rate adaptation algorithm for RTP.

   This document also gives guidance about avoiding problems with
   _nested_ congestion controllers in Section 8.2.

   This document also discusses congestion control implications of using
   shared or multiple separate QUIC connections to send and receive
   multiple independent RTP streams in Section 8.3.

8.1.  Congestion Control at the Transport Layer

   QUIC is a congestion-controlled transport protocol.  Senders are
   required to employ some form of congestion control.  The default
   congestion control specified for QUIC in [RFC9002] is similar to TCP
   NewReno [RFC6582], but senders are free to choose any congestion
   control algorithm as long as they follow the guidelines specified in
   Section 3 of [RFC8085], and QUIC implementors make use of this
   freedom.

   Congestion control mechanisms are often implemented at the transport
   layer of the protocol stack, but can also be implemented at the
   application layer.

   A congestion control mechanism could respond to actual packet loss
   (detected by timeouts), or to impending packet loss (signaled by
   mechanisms such as Explicit Congestion Notification [RFC3168]).

   For real-time traffic, it is best that the QUIC implementation uses a
   congestion controller that aims at keeping queues at intermediary
   network elements, and thus latency, as short as possible.  Delay-
   based congestion control algorithms might use, for example, an
   increasing one-way delay as a signal of impending congestion, and
   adjust the sending rate to prevent continued increases in one-way
   delay.

   A wide variety of congestion control algorithms for real-time media
   have been developed (for example, "Google Congestion Controller"
   [I-D.draft-ietf-rmcat-gcc]).  The IETF has defined two such
   algorithms in Experimental RFCs (SCReAM [RFC8298] and NADA
   [RFC8698]).  These algorithms for RTP are specifically tailored for
   real-time transmission at low latencies, but the guidance in this
   section would apply to any congestion control algorithm that meets
   the requirements described in "Congestion Control Requirements for
   Interactive Real-Time Media" [RFC8836].

   Some low latency congestion control algorithms depend on detailed
   arrival time feedback to estimate the current one-way delay between
   sender and receiver, which is unavailable in QUIC [RFC9000] without
   extensions.  QUIC implementations can use an extension to add this
   information to QUIC as described in Appendix A.  In addition to these
   dedicated real-time media congestion-control algorithms, QUIC
   implementations could support the Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable
   Throughput (L4S) Internet Service [RFC9330], which limits growth in
   round-trip delays that result from increasing queuing delays.  While
   L4S does not rely on a QUIC protocol extension, L4S does rely on
   support from network devices along the path from sender to receiver.

   The application needs a mechanism to query the available bandwidth to
   adapt media codec configurations.  If the employed congestion
   controller of the QUIC connection keeps an estimate of the available
   bandwidth, it could also expose an API to the application to query
   the current estimate.  If the congestion controller cannot provide a
   current bandwidth estimate to the application, the sender can
   implement an alternative bandwidth estimation at the application
   layer as described in Section 8.2.

   It is assumed that the congestion controller in use provides a pacing
   mechanism to determine when a packet can be sent to avoid bursts and
   minimize variation in inter-packet arrival times.  The currently
   proposed congestion control algorithms for real-time communications
   (e.g., SCReAM and NADA) provide such pacing mechanisms, and the QUIC
   exemplary congestion control algorithm (Section 7.7 of [RFC9002])
   recommends pacing for senders.

8.2.  Rate Adaptation at the Application Layer

   RTP itself does not specify a congestion control algorithm, but
   [RFC8888] defines an RTCP feedback message intended to enable rate
   adaptation for interactive real-time traffic using RTP, and
   successful rate adaptation will accomplish congestion control as
   well.

   If an application cannot access a bandwidth estimation from the QUIC
   layer, the application can alternatively implement a bandwidth
   estimation algorithm at the application layer.  Congestion control
   algorithms for real-time media such as GCC
   [I-D.draft-ietf-rmcat-gcc], NADA [RFC8698], and SCReAM [RFC8298]
   expose a target bitrate to dynamically reconfigure media codecs to
   produce media at the rate of the observed available bandwidth.
   Applications can use the same bandwidth estimation to adapt their
   rate when using QUIC.  However, running an additional congestion
   control algorithm at the application layer can have unintended
   effects due to the interaction of two _nested_ congestion
   controllers.

   If an RTP application paces its media transmission at a rate that
   does not saturate path bandwidth, more heavy-handed congestion
   control mechanisms (drastic reductions in the sending rate when loss
   is detected, with much slower increases when losses are no longer
   being detected) ought to rarely come into play.  If an RTP
   application chooses RoQ as its transport, sends enough media to
   saturate the available path bandwidth, and does not adapt its sending
   rate, these drastic measures will be required to avoid sustained or
   oscillating congestion along the path.

   Thus, applications are advised to only use the bandwidth estimation
   without running the complete congestion control algorithm at the
   application layer before passing data to the QUIC layer.

   The bandwidth estimation algorithm typically needs some feedback on
   the transmission performance.  This feedback can be collected via
   RTCP or following the guidelines in Section 10 and Section 11.

8.3.  Sharing QUIC connections

   Two endpoints can establish channels to exchange more than one type
   of data simultaneously.  The channels can be intended to carry real-
   time RTP data or other non-real-time data.  This can be realized in
   different ways.

   *  One straightforward solution is to establish multiple QUIC
      connections, one for each channel, whether the channel is used for
      real-time media or non-real-time data.

   *  Alternatively, all real-time channels are mapped to one QUIC
      connection, while a separate QUIC connection is created for the
      non-real-time channels.

   *  A third option is to multiplex all channels, whether real-time or
      non-real-time, in a single QUIC connection via an extension to
      RoQ.

   In the first two cases, the congestion controllers can be chosen to
   match the demands of the respective channels and the different QUIC
   connections will compete for the same resources in the network.  No
   local prioritization of data across the different (types of) channels
   would be necessary.

   Although it is possible to multiplex (all or a subset of) real-time
   and non-real-time channels onto a single, shared QUIC connection by
   extending RoQ, the underlying QUIC implementation will likely use the
   same congestion controller for all channels in the shared QUIC
   connection.  For this reason, applications multiplexing real-time and
   non-real-time channels in one connection will need to implement some
   form of prioritization or bandwidth allocation for the different
   channels.

9.  Guidance on Choosing QUIC Streams, QUIC DATAGRAMs, or a Mixture

   As noted in Section 3.2, this document does not take a position on
   using QUIC streams, QUIC DATAGRAMs, or a mixture of both, for any
   particular RoQ use case or application.  It does seem useful to
   include observations that might guide implementers who will need to
   make choices about that.

9.1.  RTP Considerations

   One implementation goal might be to minimize processing overhead, for
   applications that are migrating from RTP over UDP to RoQ.  These
   applications don't rely on any transport protocol behaviors beyond
   UDP, which can be described as "IP plus multiplexing".  The
   implementers might be motivated by one or more of the advantages of
   encapsulating RTP in QUIC that are described in Section 3.1, but they
   do not need any of the advantages that would apply when encapsulating
   RTP in QUIC streams.  For these applications, simply placing each RTP
   packet in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame when it becomes available would be
   sufficient, using no QUIC streams at all.

   Another implementation goal might be to prioritize specific types of
   video frames over other types.  For these applications, placing each
   type of video frame in a separate QUIC stream would allow the RoQ
   receiver to focus on the most important video frames more easily.
   This also allows the implementer to rely on QUIC's "byte stream"
   abstraction, freeing the application from dealing with MTU size
   restrictions, in contrast to the need to fit RTP packets into QUIC
   DATAGRAMs.  The application might use QUIC streams for all of the RTP
   packets carried over this specific QUIC connection, with no QUIC
   DATAGRAMs at all.

   Some applications might have implementation goals that don't fit
   neatly into "QUIC streams only" or "QUIC DATAGRAMs only" categories.
   For example, another implementation goal might be to use QUIC streams
   to carry RTP video frames, but to use QUIC DATAGRAMs to carry RTP
   audio frames, which are typically much smaller.  Because humans tend
   to tolerate inconsistent behavior in video better than inconsistent
   behavior in audio, the application might add Forward Error Correction
   [RFC6363] to RTP audio packets and encapsulate the result in QUIC
   DATAGRAMs, while encapsulating RTP video packets in QUIC streams.

   As noted in Section 5.1, all RoQ streams and RoQ datagrams begin with
   a flow identifier.  This allows a RoQ sender to begin by
   encapsulating related RTP packets in QUIC streams and then switch to
   carrying them in QUIC DATAGRAMs, or vice versa.  RoQ receivers need
   to be prepared to accept any valid RTP packet with a given flow
   identifier, whether it started by being encapsulated in QUIC streams
   or in QUIC DATAGRAMs, and RoQ receivers need to be prepared to accept
   RTP flows that switch from QUIC stream encapsulation to QUIC
   DATAGRAMs, or vice versa.

   Because QUIC provides a capability to migrate connections for various
   reasons, including recovering from a path failure (Section 9 of
   [RFC9000]), when a QUIC connection migrates, a RoQ sender has the
   opportunity to revisit decisions about which RTP packets are
   encapsulated in QUIC streams, and which RTP packets are encapsulated
   in QUIC DATAGRAMs.  Again, RoQ receivers need to be prepared for this
   eventuality.

9.2.  RTCP Considerations

   RTCP was originally defined to be used with UDP, which implies (1)
   the only buffering present would be at the IP interface level, so
   that transmission timing is largely under the control of the
   application, and (2) that the overhead, _avg_rtcp_size_, used to
   compute the RTCP transmission interval could be deterministically
   computed by adding the IP and UDP headers.  Both change when carrying
   RTCP over QUIC and they change in different ways when using QUIC
   streams vs. QUIC datagrams.

9.2.1.  RTCP over QUIC datagrams

   When sending RTCP packets in QUIC datagrams this implies that a
   packet may not be immediately transmitted as it is subject to queuing
   and multiplexing with RTP packets and subject to QUIC congestion
   control.  This means that a sending timestamp added to an RTCP
   packet, e.g., in an SR packet, may differ in unforeseeable ways from
   the actual time when the packet gets sent into the network while
   these are usually fairly close to each other for RTP-over-UDP.
   Effectively, we have a application sending timestamp _t_a_ and the
   network transmission timestamp _t_n_. Applications just have to be
   aware that RTCP does not measure the network level RTT but rather the
   application layer RTT.

   Moreover, the true overhead per RTCP packet cannot easily be
   determined: this is because, in addition to adding the IP and UDP
   headers, the QUIC (short) header and the QUIC datagram frame header
   are to be considered but their sizes vary and it is unknown which
   other frames may be sent along in the same UDP packet.  Any lower
   bound that can be determined could be affected by the version of QUIC
   being used.

   It is thus suggested that application developers recognize that per-
   RTCP packet overhead will always be an estimate, and include IP, UDP,
   QUIC, and DATAGRAM header sizes as a conservative heuristic.  While
   this value may not be precisely accurate, it follows the example of
   RTP over UDP in [RFC3550], which includes the RTP and UDP header
   sizes, and adding the additional QUIC and DATAGRAM header sizes
   avoids the immediate problem of significantly understating
   avg_rtcp_size, resulting in an underestimate of the cost of sending
   additional RTCP reports.

9.2.2.  RTCP over QUIC streams

   The above considerations from Section 9.2.1 get even more complex
   when transmitting RTCP reliably over QUIC streams: it is unknown if
   (and how many) retransmissions occurred.

   For RTT computations, again, this means that the application must
   consider that it observes the application layer RTT including
   retransmissions, where retransmissions also contribute to the
   observed jitter.

   For overhead computation, retransmissions are not explicitly
   considered nor is the multiplexing with other streams.

   To keep the complexity under control, it is again suggested that
   application developers recognize that per-RTCP packet overhead will
   always be an estimate, and these estimates should include plausible
   values for IP, UDP, QUIC, and QUIC STREAM frame header sizes.  While
   this value may not be precisely accurate, it follows the example of
   RoQ over DATAGRAMs in Section 9.2.1}, and again avoids the immediate
   problem of significantly understating avg_rtcp_size, resulting in an
   underestimate of the cost of sending additional RTCP reports.

9.2.3.  Mixed operations

   As noted in Section 9, applications may use QUIC streams, QUIC
   DATAGRAMs, or a mixture, and this extends to choices for RTP and
   RTCP.  While applications may, in principle, mix sending RTP and RTCP
   via QUIC streams and via QUIC DATAGRAMs, doing so has unforeseeable
   implications on timing and reordering and overhead.

   Using the same QUIC primitives for both RTP and RTCP when
   transporting a single media stream will be safer than mixing QUIC
   primitives - for example, using QUIC streams to carry RTP media
   payloads and QUIC DATAGRAMs to carry RTCP, or vice versa.  If an
   application uses both streams and datagrams to selectively obtain
   reliable transmission for some RTP media payloads but not for others,
   it is strongly suggested that the application developer knowingly
   choose which RTT observations they are interested in, while remaining
   aware of the advice included in Section 9.2.

   Even this awareness may not be "safe enough" - for example, [RFC9221]
   allows QUIC DATAGRAM frames to be coalesced with other QUIC frames,
   and recommends, but does not require, QUIC DATAGRAMs to be sent as
   soon as possible, or to be delivered to a receiving application
   immediately.  [RFC9221] also recommends, but does not require, a QUIC
   implementation to provide an API for prioritization between QUIC
   streams and QUIC DATAGRAMs.

10.  Replacing RTCP and RTP Header Extensions with QUIC Feedback

   Because RTP has so often used UDP as its underlying transport
   protocol, receiving little or no transport feedback, existing RTP
   implementations rely on feedback from the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)
   so that RTP senders and receivers can exchange control information to
   monitor connection statistics and to identify and synchronize media
   streams.

   Because QUIC can provide transport-level feedback, it can replace at
   least some RTP transport-level feedback with current QUIC feedback
   [RFC9000].  In addition, RTP-level feedback that is not available in
   QUIC by default can potentially be replaced with feedback provided by
   useful QUIC extensions in the future as described in Appendix B.6.

   When statistics contained in RTCP packets are also available from
   QUIC or can be derived from statistics available from QUIC, it is
   desirable to provide these statistics at only one protocol layer.
   This avoids consumption of bandwidth to deliver equivalent control
   information at more than one level of the protocol stack.  QUIC and
   RTCP both have rules describing when certain signals are to be sent.
   This document does not change any of the rules described by either
   protocol.  Rather, it specifies a baseline for replacing some of the
   RTCP packet types by mapping the contents to QUIC connection
   statistics, and reducing the transmission frequency and bandwidth
   requirements for some RTCP packet types that must be transmitted
   periodically.  Future documents can extend this mapping for other
   RTCP format types and can make use of new QUIC extensions that become
   available over time.  The mechanisms described in this section can
   enhance the statistics provided by RTCP and reduce the bandwidth
   overhead required by certain RTCP packets.  Applications using RoQ
   still need to adhere to the rules for RTCP feedback given by
   [RFC3550] and the RTP profiles in use.

   Most statements about "QUIC" in Section 10 are applicable to both RTP
   packets encapsulated in QUIC streams and RTP packets encapsulated in
   DATAGRAMs.  The differences are described in Section 10.1 and
   Section 10.2.

   While RoQ places no restrictions on applications sending RTCP, this
   document assumes that the reason an implementer chooses to support
   RoQ is to obtain benefits beyond what's available when RTP uses UDP
   as its underlying transport layer.  Exposing relevant information
   from the QUIC layer to the application instead of exchanging
   additional RTCP packets, where applicable, will reduce processing and
   bandwidth overhead for RoQ senders and receivers.

   Section 10.4 discusses what information can be exposed from the QUIC
   connection layer to reduce the RTCP overhead.

10.1.  RoQ Datagrams

   QUIC DATAGRAMs are ACK-eliciting packets, which means that an
   acknowledgment is triggered when a DATAGRAM frame is received.  Thus,
   a sender can assume that an RTP packet arrived at the receiver or was
   lost in transit, using the QUIC acknowledgments of QUIC DATAGRAM
   frames.  In the following, an RTP packet is regarded as acknowledged
   when the QUIC DATAGRAM frame that carried the RTP packet was
   acknowledged.

10.2.  RoQ Streams

   For RTP packets that are sent over QUIC streams, an RTP packet is
   considered acknowledged after all STREAM frames that carried parts of
   the RTP packet were acknowledged.

   When QUIC streams are used, the implementer needs to be aware that
   the direct mapping proposed below might not reflect the real
   characteristics of the network.  RTP packet loss can seem lower than
   actual packet loss due to QUIC's automatic retransmissions.
   Similarly, timing information can be incorrect due to retransmissions
   or transmission delays introduced by the QUIC stack.

10.3.  Multihop Topologies

   In some topologies, RoQ might only be used on some of the links
   between multiple session participants.  Other links might be using
   RTP over UDP, or over some other supported RTP encapsulation
   protocol, and some participants might be using RTP implementations
   that don't support RoQ at all.  These participants will not be able
   to infer feedback from QUIC, and they might receive less RTCP
   feedback than expected.  This situation can arise when participants
   using RoQ are not aware that other participants are not using RoQ and
   minimize their use of RTCP, assuming their RoQ peer will be able to
   infer statistics from QUIC.  There are two ways to solve this
   problem:

   *  If the middlebox translating between RoQ and RTP over other RTP
      transport protocols such as UDP or TCP provides Back-to-Back RTP
      sessions as described in Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7667], this
      middlebox can add RTCP packets for the participants not using RoQ
      by using the statistics the middlebox gets from QUIC and the
      mappings described in the following sections.

   *  If the middlebox does not provide Back-to-Back RTP sessions,
      participants can use additional signaling to let the RoQ
      participants know what RTCP is required.

10.4.  Feedback Mappings

   This section explains how some of the RTCP packet types that are used
   to signal reception statistics can be replaced by equivalent
   statistics that are already collected by QUIC.  The following list
   explains how this mapping can be achieved for the individual fields
   of different RTCP packet types.

   The list of RTCP packets in this section is not exhaustive, and
   similar considerations would apply when exchanging any other type of
   RTCP control packets using RoQ.

   A more thorough analysis including the information that cannot be
   mapped from QUIC can be found in Appendix B: RTCP Control Packet
   Types (in Appendix B.1), Generic RTP Feedback (RTPFB) (in
   Appendix B.3), Payload-specific RTP Feedback (PSFB) (in
   Appendix B.4), Extended Reports (in Appendix B.2), and RTP Header
   Extensions (in Appendix B.5).

10.4.1.  Negative Acknowledgments ("NACK")

   Generic _Negative Acknowledgments_ (PT=205, FMT=1, Name=Generic NACK,
   [RFC4585]) contain information about RTP packets which the receiver
   considered lost.  Section 6.2.1. of [RFC4585] recommends using this
   feature only if the underlying protocol cannot provide similar
   feedback.  QUIC does not provide negative acknowledgments but can
   detect lost packets based on the Gap numbers contained in QUIC ACK
   frames (Section 6 of [RFC9002]).

10.4.2.  ECN Feedback ("ECN")

   _ECN Feedback_ (PT=205, FMT=8, Name=RTCP-ECN-FB, [RFC6679]) packets
   report the count of observed ECN-CE marks.  [RFC6679] defines two
   RTCP reports, one packet type (with PT=205 and FMT=8), and a new
   report block for the extended reports.  QUIC supports ECN reporting
   through acknowledgments.  If the QUIC connection supports ECN, using
   QUIC acknowledgments to report ECN counts, rather than RTCP ECN
   feedback reports, reduces bandwidth and processing demands on the
   RTCP implementation.

10.4.3.  Goodbye Packets ("BYE")

   RTP session participants can use _Goodbye_ RTCP packets (PT=203,
   Name=BYE, [RFC3550]), to indicate that a source is no longer active.
   If the participant is also going to close the QUIC connection, the
   _BYE_ packet can be replaced by a QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.  In
   this case, the reason for leaving can be transmitted in QUIC's
   CONNECTION_CLOSE _Reason Phrase_. However, if the participant wishes
   to use this QUIC connection for any other multiplexed traffic, the
   participant has to use the BYE packet because the QUIC
   CONNECTION_CLOSE would close the entire QUIC connection for all other
   QUIC streams and DATAGRAMs.

11.  RoQ-QUIC and RoQ-RTP API Considerations

   The mapping described in the previous sections relies on the QUIC
   implementation passing some information to the RoQ implementation.
   Although RoQ will function without this information, some
   optimizations regarding rate adaptation and RTCP mapping require
   certain functionalities to be exposed to the application.

   Each item in the following list can be considered individually.  Any
   exposed information or function can be used by RoQ regardless of
   whether the other items are available.  Thus, RoQ does not depend on
   the availability of all of the listed features but can apply
   different optimizations depending on the functionality exposed by the
   QUIC implementation.

   *  _initial_max_data transport_: If the QUIC receiver has indicated a
      willingness to accept 0-RTT packets with early data, this is the
      maximum size that the QUIC sender can use, as described in
      Section 12.2.

   *  _Maximum Datagram Size_: The maximum DATAGRAM size that the QUIC
      connection can transmit on the network path to the QUIC receiver.
      If a RoQ sender using DATAGRAMs does not know the maximum DATAGRAM
      size for the path to the RoQ receiver, there are only two choices
      - either use heuristics to limit the size of RoQ messages, or be
      prepared to lose RoQ messages that were too large to be carried
      through the network path and delivered to the RoQ receiver.

   *  _Datagram Acknowledgment and Loss_: Section 5.2 of [RFC9221]
      allows QUIC implementations to notify the application that a
      DATAGRAM was acknowledged or that it believes a DATAGRAM was lost.
      Given the DATAGRAM acknowledgments and losses, the application can
      deduce which RTP packets arrived at the receiver and which were
      lost (see also Section 10.1).

   *  _Stream States_: The stream states include which parts of the data
      sent on a stream were successfully delivered and which are still
      outstanding to be sent or retransmitted.  If an application keeps
      track of the RTP packets sent on a stream, their respective sizes,
      and in which order they were transmitted, it can infer which RTP
      packets were acknowledged according to the definition in
      Section 10.2.

   *  _Arrival timestamps_: If the QUIC connection uses a timestamp
      extension like [I-D.draft-smith-quic-receive-ts] or
      [I-D.draft-huitema-quic-ts], the arrival timestamps or one-way
      delays can support the application as described in Section 10 and
      Section 8.

   *  _Bandwidth Estimation_: If a bandwidth estimate is available in
      the QUIC implementation, exposing it avoids the overhead of
      executing an additional bandwidth estimation algorithm in the
      application.

   *  _ECN_: If ECN marks are available, they can support the bandwidth
      estimation of the application.

   *  _RTT_: The RTT estimations as described in Section 5 of [RFC9002].

   One goal for the RoQ protocol is to shield RTP applications from the
   details of QUIC encapsulation, so the RTP application doesn't need
   much information about QUIC from RoQ, but some information will be
   valuable.  For example, it could be desirable that the RoQ
   implementation provides an indication of connection migration to the
   RTP application.

   Because RTP applications do use the application timestamps contained
   in RTCP packets in a variety of ways, a RoQ implementation that
   provides and event-driven API can allow RoQ applications to generate
   RTCP packets "at the last moment", when the RoQ application is able
   to send the RTCP packet, and allow RoQ applications to notice that
   QUIC congestion control is limiting the ability of the RoQ
   application to send packets without this delay.

12.  Discussion

   This section contains topics that are worth mentioning, but don't fit
   well into other sections of the document.

12.1.  Impact of Connection Migration

   RTP sessions are characterized by a continuous flow of packets in
   either or both directions.  A connection migration might lead to
   pausing media transmission until reachability of the peer under the
   new address is validated.  This might lead to short breaks in media
   delivery in the order of RTT and, if RTCP is used for RTT
   measurements, might cause spikes in observed delays.  Application
   layer congestion control mechanisms (and packet repair schemes such
   as retransmissions) need to be prepared to cope with such spikes.  As
   noted in Section 11, it could be desirable that the RoQ
   implementation provides an indication of connection migration to the
   RTP application, to assist in coping.

12.2.  0-RTT and Early Data considerations

   RoQ applications, like any other RTP applications, want to establish
   a media path quickly, reducing clipping at the beginning of a
   conversation.  For repeated connections between endpoints that have
   previously carried out a full TLS handshake procedure, the initiator
   of a QUIC connection can use 0-RTT packets with "early data" to
   include application data in a packet that is used to establish a
   connection.

   As 0-RTT packets are subject to replay attacks, RoQ applications MUST
   carefully specify which data types and operations are allowed.

   Section 9.2 of [RFC9001] says

      Application protocols MUST either prohibit the use of extensions
      that carry application semantics in 0-RTT or provide replay
      mitigation strategies.

   For the purposes of this discussion, RoQ is an application protocol
   that allows the use of 0-RTT.

   RoQ application developers ought to take the considerations described
   in Section 12.2.1 and Section 12.2.2 into account when deciding
   whether to use 0-RTT with early data for an application.

12.2.1.  Effect of 0-RTT Rejection for RoQ using Early Data

   If the goal for using early data is to reduce clipping, a QUIC
   endpoint is relying on the other QUIC endpoint to accept the 0-RTT
   packet carrying early data containing media.

   A QUIC endpoint indicates its willingness to accept a 0-RTT packet
   containing early data by sending the TLS early_data extension in the
   NewSessionTicket message with the max_early_data_size parameter set
   to the sentinel value 0xffffffff.  The amount of data that a QUIC
   client can send in QUIC 0-RTT is controlled by the initial_max_data
   transport parameter supplied by the QUIC server.  This is described
   in more detail in Section 4.6.1 of [RFC9001].

   If a QUIC endpoint is not willing to accept a 0-RTT packet containing
   early data, but receives one anyway, the QUIC endpoint rejects the
   0-RTT packet by sending EncryptedExtensions without an early_data
   extension.  This is described in more detail, in Section 4.6.2 of
   [RFC9001].  This necessarily means that a QUIC endpoint attempting to
   convey RoQ media is now subject to at least one additional RTT delay,
   as it must send a QUIC Initial packet and perform a full QUIC
   handshake before it can send RoQ media.

12.2.2.  Effect of 0-RTT Replay Attacks for RoQ using Early Data

   Including "early data" in the packet payload in any QUIC 0-RTT packet
   exposes the application to an additional risk, of accepting "early
   data" from a 0-RTT packet that has been replayed.

   While it is true that

   *  RTP typically carries ephemeral media contents that is rendered
      and possibly recorded but otherwise causes no side effects,

   *  the amount of data that can be carried as packet payload in a
      0-RTT packet is rather limited, and

   *  RTP implementations are likely to discard any replayed media
      packets as duplicates,

   it is still the responsibility of the RoQ application to determine
   whether the benefits of using 0-RTT with early data outweigh the
   risks.

   Since the QUIC connection will often be created in the context of an
   existing signaling relationship (e.g., using WebRTC or SIP), a
   careful RoQ implementer can exchange specific 0-RTT keying material
   to prevent replays across sessions.

12.3.  Coalescing RTP packets in a single QUIC packet

   Applications have some control over how the QUIC stack maps
   application data to QUIC frames, but applications cannot control how
   the QUIC stack maps STREAM and DATAGRAM frames to QUIC packets
   Section 13 of [RFC9000] and Section 5 of [RFC9308].

   *  When RTP payloads are carried over QUIC streams, the RTP payload
      is treated as an ordered byte stream that will be carried in QUIC
      STREAM frames, with no effort to match application data
      boundaries.

   *  When RTP payloads are carried over DATAGRAMs, each RTP payload
      data unit is mapped into a DATAGRAM frame, but

   *  QUIC implementations can include multiple STREAM frames from
      different streams and one or more DATAGRAM frames into a single
      QUIC packet, and can include other QUIC frames as well.

   QUIC stacks are allowed to wait for a short period of time if the
   queued QUIC packet is shorter than the Path MTU, in order to optimize
   for bandwidth utilization instead of latency, while real-time
   applications usually prefer to optimize for latency rather than
   bandwidth utilization.  This waiting interval is under the QUIC
   implementation's control, and could be based on knowledge about
   application sending behavior or heuristics to determine whether and
   for how long to wait.

   When there are a lot of small DATAGRAM frames (e.g., an audio stream)
   and a lot of large DATAGRAM frames (e.g., a video stream), it could
   be a good idea to make sure the audio frames can be included in a
   QUIC packet that also carries video frames (i.e., the video frames
   don't fill the whole QUIC packet).  Otherwise, the QUIC stack might
   have to send additional small packets only carrying single audio
   frames, which would waste some bandwidth.

   Application designers are advised to take these considerations into
   account when selecting and configuring a QUIC stack for use with RoQ.

13.  Directions for Future Work

   This document describes RoQ in sufficient detail that an implementer
   can build a RoQ application, but we recognize that additional work is
   likely, after we have sufficient experience with RoQ to guide that
   work (Section 13.1) and as new QUIC extensions become available
   (Section 13.2).

13.1.  Future Work Resulting from Implementation and Deployment
       Experience

   Possible directions would include

   *  More guidance on transport for RTCP (for example, when to use QUIC
      streams vs. DATAGRAMs) including guidance on prioritization
      between streams and DATAGRAMs for the performance of RTCP.

   *  More guidance on the use of real-time-friendly congestion control
      algorithms (for example, Copa [Copa], L4S [RFC9330], etc.).

   *  More guidance for congestion control and rate adaptation for
      multiple RoQ flows (whether streams or datagrams).

   *  Possible guidance for connection sharing between real-time and
      non-real-time flows, including considerations for congestion
      control and rate adaptation, scheduling, prioritization, and which
      ALPNs to use.

   *  Investigation of the effects of delaying or dropping DATAGRAMs due
      to congestion before they can be transmitted by the QUIC stack.

   *  Implementation of translating middleboxes for translating between
      RoQ and RTP over UDP.  As described in Section 3.3, RoQ can be
      used to connect to some RTP middleboxes using some topologies, and
      these middleboxes might be connecting RoQ endpoints and non-RoQ
      endpoints, so will need to translate between RoQ and RTP over UDP.

   For these reasons, publication of this document as a stable reference
   for implementers to test with, and report results, seems useful.

13.2.  Future Work Resulting from New QUIC Extensions

   In addition, as noted in Section 3.1.7, one of the motivations for
   using QUIC as a transport for RTP is to exploit new QUIC extensions
   as they become available.  We noted several specific proposed QUIC
   extensions in Appendix A, but these proposals are all solving
   relevant problems, and those problems are worth solving for the QUIC
   protocol, whether the listed proposals are used in the solution or
   not.

   *  Guidance for using RoQ with QUIC connection migration and over
      multiple paths.  QUIC connection migration was already defined in
      [RFC9000], and the Multipath Extension for QUIC
      [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath] has been adopted and is relatively
      mature, so this is likely to be the first new QUIC extension we
      address.

   *  Guidance for using RoQ with QUIC NAT traversal solutions.  This
      could use Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC8445]
      or other NAT traversal solutions.

   *  Guidance for improved jitter calculations to use with congestion
      control and rate adaptation.

   *  Guidance for other aspects of QUIC performance optimization
      relying on extensions.

   Other QUIC extensions, not yet proposed, might also be useful with
   RoQ.

14.  Implementation Status

      *RFC Editor's note:* Please remove this section prior to
      publication of a final version of this document.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

   Implementation:  [roq]

   Description:  _roq_ is a library implementing the basic encapsulation
      described in Section 5.  The library uses the Go programming
      language and supports the [quic-go] QUIC implementation.

   Level of Maturity:  prototype

   Coverage: : The library supports sending and receiving RTP and RTCP
   packets using QUIC streams and QUIC DATAGRAMs, and supports
   multiplexing using flow identifiers.  Applications using the library
   are responsible for appropriate signaling, setting up QUIC
   connections, and managing RTP sessions.  Applications choose whether
   to send RTP and RTCP packets over streams or DATAGRAMs, and
   applications also have control over the QUIC and RTP congestion
   controllers in use since they control the QUIC connection setup and
   can thus configure the QUIC stack they use to their preferences.

   Version Compatibility:  The library implements
      [I-D.draft-ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic-10].

   Licensing:  MIT License

   Implementation Experience:  The implementer reports they have no
      experience with the topics discussed in Section 13.  RoQ relies on
      out-of-band signaling for connection establishment, and since
      there is currently no specification for SDP for RoQ, applications
      using the library have to statically configure connection
      information to allow testing

15.  Security Considerations

   RoQ is subject to the security considerations of RTP described in
   Section 9 of [RFC3550] and the security considerations of any RTP
   profile in use.

   The security considerations for the QUIC protocol and DATAGRAM
   extension described in Section 21 of [RFC9000], Section 9 of
   [RFC9001], Section 8 of [RFC9002] and Section 6 of [RFC9221] also
   apply to RoQ.

   Note that RoQ provides mandatory security, and other RTP transports
   do not.  In order to prevent the inadvertent disclosure of RTP
   sessions to unintended third parties, RTP topologies described in
   Section 3.3 that include middleboxes supporting both RoQ and non-RoQ
   paths MUST forward RTP packets on non-RoQ paths using a secure AVP
   profile ([RFC3711], [RFC4585], or another AVP profile providing
   equivalent RTP-level security), whether or not RoQ senders are using
   a secure AVP profile for those RTP packets.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a new ALPN protocol ID (in Section 16.1) and
   creates a new registry that manages the assignment of error code
   points in RoQ (in Section 16.2).

16.1.  Registration of a RoQ Identification String

   This document creates a new registration for the identification of
   RoQ in the "TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
   Protocol IDs" registry [RFC7301].

   The "roq" string identifies RoQ:

   Protocol:  RTP over QUIC (RoQ)

   Identification Sequence:  0x72 0x6F 0x71 ("roq")

   Specification:  This document

16.2.  RoQ Error Codes Registry

   This document establishes a registry for RoQ error codes.  The "RTP
   over QUIC (RoQ) Error Codes" registry manages a 62-bit space and is
   listed under the "Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Parameters"
   heading.

   The new error codes registry created in this document operates under
   the QUIC registration policy documented in Section 22.1 of [RFC9000].
   This registry includes the common set of fields listed in
   Section 22.1.1 of [RFC9000].

   Permanent registrations in this registry are assigned using the
   Specification Required policy ([RFC8126]), except for values between
   0x00 and 0x3f (in hexadecimal; inclusive), which are assigned using
   Standards Action or IESG Approval as defined in Sections 4.9 and 4.10
   of [RFC8126].

   Registrations for error codes are required to include a description
   of the error code.  An expert reviewer is advised to examine new
   registrations for possible duplication or interaction with existing
   error codes.

   In addition to common fields as described in Section Section 22.1 of
   [RFC9000], this registry includes two additional fields.  Permanent
   registrations in this registry MUST include the following fields:

   Name:  A name for the error code.

   Description:  A brief description of the error code semantics, which
      can be a summary if a specification reference is provided.

   The initial allocations in this registry are all assigned permanent
   status and list a change controller of the IETF and a contact of the
   AVTCORE working group (avt@ietf.org).

   The entries in Table 2 are registered by this document.

Appendix A.  List of optional QUIC Extensions

   The following is a list of QUIC protocol extensions that could be
   beneficial for RoQ, but are not required by RoQ.

   *  _An Unreliable Datagram Extension to QUIC_ [RFC9221].  Without
      support for unreliable DATAGRAMs, RoQ cannot use the encapsulation
      specified in Section 5.3, but can still use QUIC streams as
      specified in Section 5.2.

   *  A version of QUIC receive timestamps can be helpful for improved
      jitter calculations and congestion control.  If the QUIC
      connection uses a timestamp extension such as _Quic Timestamps For
      Measuring One-Way Delays_ [I-D.draft-huitema-quic-ts] or _QUIC
      Extension for Reporting Packet Receive Timestamps_
      [I-D.draft-smith-quic-receive-ts], the arrival timestamps or one-
      way delays could be exposed to the application for improved
      bandwidth estimation or RTCP mappings as described in Section 10
      and Appendix B.

   *  _QUIC Acknowledgment Frequency_
      [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-ack-frequency] can be used by a sender to
      optimize the acknowledgment behavior of the receiver, e.g., to
      optimize congestion control.

   *  _Signaling That a QUIC Receiver Has Enough Stream Data_
      [I-D.draft-thomson-quic-enough] and _Reliable QUIC Stream Resets_
      [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-reliable-stream-reset] would allow RoQ
      senders and receivers to use versions of CLOSE_STREAM and
      STOP_SENDING that contain offsets.  The offset could be used to
      reliably retransmit all frames up to a certain frame that ought to
      be cancelled before resuming transmission of further frames on new
      QUIC streams.

Appendix B.  Considered RTCP Packet Types and RTP Header Extensions

   This section lists all the RTCP packet types and RTP header
   extensions that were considered in the analysis described in
   Section 10.

   Each subsection in Appendix B corresponds to an IANA registry, and
   includes a reference pointing to that registry.

   Several but not all of these control packets and their attributes can
   be mapped from QUIC, as described in Section 10.4. _Mappable from
   QUIC_ has one of four values: _yes_, _partly_, _QUIC extension
   needed_, and _no_. _Partly_ is used for packet types for which some
   fields can be mapped from QUIC, but not all. _QUIC extension needed_
   describes packet types which could be mapped with help from one or
   more QUIC extensions.

   Examples of how certain packet types could be mapped with the help of
   QUIC extensions follow in Appendix B.6.

B.5.  RTP Header extensions

   Like the payload-specific feedback packets, QUIC cannot directly
   replace the control information in the following header extensions.
   RoQ does not place restrictions on sending any RTP header extensions.
   However, some extensions, such as Transmission Time offsets [RFC5450]
   are used to improve network jitter calculation, which can be done in
   QUIC if a timestamp extension is used.

B.6.  Examples

B.6.1.  Mapping QUIC Feedback to RTCP Receiver Reports ("RR")

   Considerations for mapping QUIC feedback into _Receiver Reports_
   (PT=201, Name=RR, [RFC3550]) are:

   *  _Fraction lost_: When RTP packets are carried in DATAGRAMs, the
      fraction of lost packets can be directly inferred from QUIC's
      acknowledgments.  The calculation includes all packets up to the
      acknowledged RTP packet with the highest RTP sequence number.

   *  _Cumulative lost_: Similar to the fraction of lost packets, the
      cumulative loss can be inferred from QUIC's acknowledgments,
      including all packets up to the latest acknowledged packet.

   *  _Highest Sequence Number received_: In RTCP, this field is a
      32-bit field that contains the highest sequence number a receiver
      received in an RTP packet and the count of sequence number cycles
      the receiver has observed.  A sender sends RTP packets in QUIC
      packets and receives acknowledgments for the QUIC packets.  By
      keeping a mapping from a QUIC packet to the RTP packets
      encapsulated in that QUIC packet, the sender can infer the highest
      sequence number and number of cycles seen by the receiver from
      QUIC acknowledgments.

   *  _Interarrival jitter_: If QUIC acknowledgments carry timestamps as
      described in [I-D.draft-smith-quic-receive-ts], senders can infer
      the interarrival jitter from the arrival timestamps in QUIC
      acknowledgments.

   *  _Last SR_: Similar to lost packets, the NTP timestamp of the last
      received sender report can be inferred from QUIC acknowledgments.

   *  _Delay since last SR_: This field is not required when the
      receiver reports are entirely replaced by QUIC feedback.

B.6.2.  Congestion Control Feedback ("CCFB")

   RTP _Congestion Control Feedback_ (PT=205, FMT=11, Name=CCFB,
   [RFC8888]) contains acknowledgments, arrival timestamps, and ECN
   notifications for each received packet.  Acknowledgments and ECNs can
   be inferred from QUIC as described above.  Arrival timestamps can be
   added through extended acknowledgment frames as described in
   [I-D.draft-smith-quic-receive-ts] or [I-D.draft-huitema-quic-ts].

B.6.3.  Extended Report ("XR")

   _Extended Reports_ (PT=207, Name=XR, [RFC3611]) offer an extensible
   framework for a variety of different control messages.  Some of the
   statistics that are defined as extended report blocks can be derived
   from QUIC, too.  Other report blocks need to be evaluated
   individually to determine whether the contained information can be
   transmitted using QUIC instead.  Table 4 in Appendix B.2 lists
   considerations for mapping QUIC feedback to some of the _Extended
   Reports_.

B.6.4.  Application Layer Repair and other Control Messages

   While Appendix B.6.1 presented some RTCP packets that can be replaced
   by QUIC features, QUIC cannot replace all of the defined RTCP packet
   types.  This mostly affects RTCP packet types, which carry control
   information that is to be interpreted by the RTP application layer
   rather than the underlying transport protocol itself.

   *  _Sender Reports_ (PT=200, Name=SR, [RFC3550]) are similar to
      _Receiver Reports_, as described in Appendix B.6.1.  They are sent
      by media senders and additionally contain an NTP and an RTP
      timestamp and the number of packets and octets transmitted by the
      sender.  The timestamps can be used by a receiver to synchronize
      media streams.  QUIC cannot provide similar control information
      since it does not know about RTP timestamps.  A QUIC receiver
      cannot calculate the packet or octet counts since it does not know
      about lost DATAGRAMs.  Thus, sender reports are necessary in RoQ
      to synchronize media streams at the receiver.

   In addition to carrying transmission statistics, RTCP packets can
   contain application layer control information that cannot directly be
   mapped to QUIC.  Examples of this information might include:

   *  _Source Description_ (PT=202, Name=SDES) and _Application_
      (PT=204, Name=APP) packet types from [RFC3550], or

   *  many of the payload-specific feedback messages (PT=206) defined in
      [RFC4585], used to control the codec behavior of the sender.

   Since QUIC does not provide any kind of application layer control
   messaging, QUIC feedback cannot be mapped into these RTCP packet
   types.  If the RTP application needs this information, the RTCP
   packet types are used in the same way as they would be used over any
   other transport protocol.

Acknowledgments

   Early versions of this document were similar in spirit to
   [I-D.draft-hurst-quic-rtp-tunnelling], although many details differ.
   The authors would like to thank Sam Hurst for providing his thoughts
   about how QUIC could be used to carry RTP.

   The guidance in Section 5.2 about configuring the number of parallel
   unidirectional QUIC streams is based on Section 6.2 of [RFC9114],
   with obvious substitutions for RTP.

   The authors would like to thank Bernard Aboba, David Schinazi, Gurtej
   Singh Chandok, Lucas Pardue, Sam Hurst, Sergio Garcia Murillo, and
   Vidhi Goel for their valuable comments and suggestions contributing
   to this document.
